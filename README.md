# self-service-kiosk

## Opening up kiosk creation to everyone

`self-service-kiosk` is an Open Source project designed to democratize the process of creating kiosk software.

We plan to offer kiosk creation and management as a service at http://www.self-service-kiosk.com but the core code will be available as Open Source at https://github.com/TheSwanFactory/self-service-kiosk/.

Our dream is to become the Wordpress.com of kiosk software, so people can create and maintain a kiosk as easy and reliable as a blog.

The Self Service Kiosk is the second product of The Swan Factory, inspired by our earlier work on The Hour of NODE.
