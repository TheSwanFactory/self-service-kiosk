# self-service-kiosk

## Opening up kiosk creation to everyone

`self-service-kiosk` is an Open Source project designed to democratize the process of creating kiosk software.

We plan to offer kiosk creation and management as a service at http://www.self-service-kiosk.com but the core code will be available as Open Source at https://github.com/TheSwanFactory/self-service-kiosk/.

Our dream is to become the [Wordpress.com][http://wordpress.com] of kiosk software, enabling users to create and maintain a kiosk as easily and reliably as a blog.

The Self Service Kiosk is the second product of [The Swan Factory](www.theswanfactory.com), inspired by our earlier work on the [Hour of NODE](hourofnode.org).
