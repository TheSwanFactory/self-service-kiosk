# kiosk-config.coffee
#
# This is an example kiosk configuration JSON file
# written in [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/TheSwanFactory/hourofnode/wiki/CoffeeScript).
#
# Our plan is for these to be:
# * created and edited via our web GUI
# * stored in a NoSQL database
# * imported to create dynamic Kiosk objects
# * exported as static HTML pages (with associated JavaScript)
# * packaged as offline Chrome app .crx archives

# Key Features
# ============
#
# * Home page screensaver
# * Multiple question types (a la Google Forms)
# * Conditional questions
# * Save responses via email or database
# * Display advertising via iframes
